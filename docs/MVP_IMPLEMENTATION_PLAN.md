## üö® Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Celery Setup Complexity**: Start with minimal configuration, add features incrementally
- **YOLO Integration Issues**: Preserve existing working code, wrap with new interface
- **File Handling Edge Cases**: Focus on happy path first, add error handling later

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Stick strictly to Camera Data Flow, defer other features
- **Testing Time**: Prioritize working system over comprehensive testing
- **Integration Issues**: Test components individually before full integration

## üìù Notes & Assumptions

- **Existing YOLO code** in `etc/test/` is working and will be preserved
- **Project structure** is already set up and ready for implementation
- **Focus on functionality** over perfect code quality for MVP
- **Resilience features** will be basic but demonstrable
- **Success measured by** working demo, not production readiness
